Project 1:
Create a reverse Bubble sort

Project 2:
You are required to read two unsigned integers from the console. The valid range for
both values is 0 to 65535. Your program will multiply and divide them and provide
the product, quotient, and remainder. Your program must include a trap (i.e. a
notification and graceful exit) for divide-by-zero.

Project 3:
Emulating the floating point number addition
